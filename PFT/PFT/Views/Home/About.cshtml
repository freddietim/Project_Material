        A reliable lost and found service is an invaluable service so we figured why not create one!<br>
        It all began many moons ago when I lost my purse in college. I had no idea where to begin looking.<br>
        I then thought to myself wouldn't it be convenient to have a medium through which I could search all of the potential places I lost it at once?! And so the idea was born.
